                        <h1>The Saxophone</h1>
                        <p>My first instrument was the saxophone which I only played for a year in the 6th grade. I soon discoverd that I had a natrual talent for music.</p>

                        <p>My second instrument was the snare drum. I made a switch in the 7th grade from the sax because I felt I would injoy precussion instruments more.</p>

                        <h1>Marching Band Drumline</h1>
                        <p>Once I was in high school I continued to play the drums, but marching band in itself was a whole different story. The drums were the same but the way we played them were very different. Now I was requrired to not only play but to also move and perform at the same time.</p>

                        <h1>The Quints</h1>
                        <p>The quints are just like any other drum but there are 5 of them. I dont need to tell you how this adds to the difficulty.</p>

                        <h1>The Steel Drums</h1>
                        <p>The steel drum is one of my favorite drums. These are the ones that you would typically associate with tropical climate. These drums can literally make up there own band which is what I was in a steel drum band.</p>

                        <h1>The Piano</h1>
                        <p>Now that I have drums mastered it was time to try something else. I like to make beats for artist to sing or rap over. So I begin to take piano by ear to compose what is in my head. I am still in the process of learning the piano ,but it is coming along nicely.</p>

                        <h1>The Guitar</h1>
                        <p>This is the last on my list to learn. I have not started on this insrument yet, but it will be tackled in the future so I felf it worth mentioning.</p>
